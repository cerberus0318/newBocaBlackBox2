    box_info: "\_\_\_\n\nEric Johanson is a triple-threat artist. The multiple-Top 10 Billboard-charting guitarist, vocalist, and songwriterâ€™s original music reaches beyond traditional genre lines of blues, rock, and progressive Americana, all while feeding off the groove and history of his home in New Orleans. His four most recent solo releases: Live at DBA, New Orleans Bootleg, Covered Tracks, Vol. 1, Covered Tracks, Vol. 2 and Below Sea Level all reached Top 10 on the Billboard blues charts and the January 23, 2023 issue of Guitar Player magazine listed him as one of 25 Top New Blues Guitarists.\n\nA self-taught prodigy, Johanson grew up in Louisiana, where he received his first guitar at five. By his pre-teens, his love of the blues records played in his home, featuring artists like Freddie King, Robert Johnson and Buddy Guy, merged with his love for the hard rock sounds of Metallica, White Zombie, Soundgarden and Nine Inch Nails. Throughout his teens, he performed with older blues musicians, building a reputation as a budding regional star. In college in New Orleans, he began a lifelong exploration of his musical interests, delving into progressive rock and beat-making while developing his blues voice. Johanson spent several years in New Zealand before returning home to the improvisational and extemporaneous nature of roots music in his hometown.\n"
