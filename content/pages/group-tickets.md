        description: >
          Eric Johanson is a triple-threat artist. The multiple-Top 10
          Billboard-charting guitarist, vocalist, and songwriter’s original
          music reaches beyond traditional genre lines of blues, rock, and
          progressive Americana, all while feeding off the groove and history of
          his home in New Orleans. His four most recent solo releases: Live at
          DBA, New Orleans Bootleg, Covered Tracks, Vol. 1, Covered Tracks, Vol.
          2 and Below Sea Level all reached Top 10 on the Billboard blues charts
          and the January 23, 2023 issue of Guitar Player magazine listed him as
          one of 25 Top New Blues Guitarists.

      - title: COMEDIAN MICHELE BALAN
        description: >
          Like a lot of developers, I always wished I could make my ideas look
          awesome without relying on a designer, but any time I tried to design
          something myself I would always get frustrated and give up.


          I always chalked it up to a left brain/right brain sort of thing — I'm
          logical and analytical so I'm good at programming, people like Steve
          are intuitive and creative so he's good at design.


          But after working closely with Steve I started picking up little
          tricks. Tricks that didn't require any artistic talent, but made
          things look better instantly for reasons that made sense to me as a
          developer.


          ### Design with tactics, not talent.


          Here's a concrete design tactic I bet you see applied every day but
          haven't explicitly noticed.


          Use fewer borders.


          Borders are a great way to distinguish two elements from one another,
          but using too many of them can make your design feel busy and
          cluttered.


          Instead, try adding a box shadow, using contrasting background colors,
          or simply adding more space between elements.


          It doesn't take any talent to make changes like this — once you know
          the tactic you just need to notice the problem and apply the solution.
