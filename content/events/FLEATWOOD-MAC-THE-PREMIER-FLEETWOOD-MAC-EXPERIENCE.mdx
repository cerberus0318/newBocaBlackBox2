  As they performed at university events and around town, music became more
  important than classes. They started a band, the B2wins, which they pronounced
  B Twins for Brazilian Twins, where they put their own classical spin on the

  throughout Iowa and the Midwest and they became full-time musicians. They both
  married. Their American dream was becoming a reality.
