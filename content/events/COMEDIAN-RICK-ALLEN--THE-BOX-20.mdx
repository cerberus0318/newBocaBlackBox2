description: >+
  In the summer of 2006, the president of the World Food Prize, Ambassador
  Kenneth Quinn, was planning an event to celebrate people who had made a
  difference in the availability of food in the world. He heard the NPR segment
  on the Caldas twins and invited them to Iowa to perform. They were given
  visas, travel and a three-day stay at a Des Moines hotel. They weren’t
  nervous, even though they decided their program ten minutes before they
  performed, Walter on the violin and Wagner on the ukulele. “They dazzled,”
  Quinn said. “They had the energy of youth; they just had this verve to them.
  You could see it and feel it in the room.”


  Their unique style led Benjamin Allen, then president of the University of
  Northern Iowa, to approach them through a translator and offer them full
  scholarships to study music at the university. “We thought it was just talk,”
  Walter said. “A month later, we started receiving stuff in Brazil from UNI,
  everything in English, with pictures of the dorms, and I was like, ‘Oh, my
  God, we’re really going.”
