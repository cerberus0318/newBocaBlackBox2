  "A remarkable, contemporary bluesman...a powerhouse young guitarist and
  soulful vocalist. A major player...highly recommended." –ROLLING STONE


  "This singer-songwriter continues to leap forward…intent on both working in
  the blues idiom and expanding on it. Stories and sounds combine to haunt
  beyond their specific references, as the best blues songs will." –THE WALL
  STREET JOURNAL

  With the quality of his material, combined with a vibrant stage persona,

  mean and tough…lyrically and musically intense" –AMERICAN SONGWRITER
