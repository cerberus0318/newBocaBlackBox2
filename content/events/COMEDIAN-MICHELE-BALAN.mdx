title: COMEDIAN MICHELE BALAN
description: >
  It’s a long way from the mean streets of the Brazilian favelas to the
  tree-lined campus of an Iowa university, yet that’s the extraordinary journey
  musical twins Walter and Wagner Caldas made. The thirty-something-year-olds
  got their first instruments, violins, from their father, who had a small
  woodshop and made instruments for a local orchestra designed to keep kids off
  the streets. The boys took lessons, joined the orchestra at 12, and began
  traveling outside the favela. They also memorized pop songs by Justin
  Timberlake and Michael Jackson.


  The orchestra played for celebrities and dignitaries and the twins, with their
  high-energy takes on classical music, stood out. After a performance in Rio de
  Janeiro in 2006, an NPR producer did a story on them and they began to imagine
  life outside the favela. “Art, in general, it takes you somewhere, somehow,”
  Walter said. “It gave everyone a vision of the world they didn’t have,
  including me.”
