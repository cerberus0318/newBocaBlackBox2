  The twins didn’t tell their parents because they knew their mom and dad would
  be afraid for them. They got help filling out the applications from others.
  Neither twin could speak or write English then and people in Brazil made them
  signs in English to help them navigate the airports.


  Learning English was hard and the twins were often homesick, but they never
  regretted their decision to come to America. “Having each other was a big part
  of it,” Walter said. “We never let each other feel sorry about anything in our
  lives.”
